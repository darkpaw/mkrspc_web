    <p>
        We are a Makerspace, (or Hackerspace).
        The basic concept is a not-for-profit communal space, that anyone can use, with access to communal tools and shared skills, to make or fix things.
        This might be for example, a sewing space, an electronics space, a woodworking space, a metal working space, a mechanical repairs/maintenance space etc.
        Newcastle Makerspace is currently fairly electronics-focussed, but we're not about setting limits, and if you want to bring in other ideas/skills/tools, then feel free!

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The Makerspace was started in early 2014 after some online discussion and physical meetings late in 2013.</p>
    <!-- <p>Some more text would be good to have here, maybe a description of what we have done so far, how the group is organised (or not organised).</p>
    <p>A fancy image gallery would be nice too, especially if it was easy for members to add images.</p>
